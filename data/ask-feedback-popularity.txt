Dear @NAME@,

as discussed at the CMG group meeting in June [1] we want to use data
popularity to manage the eos space of the CMS T3.
There's some directories (full list below) in the CMS T3 eos space which belong to you
and have gone 'stale' , hence you receive this automated email.

The current definition of 'stale' is [2]:
   data created > 120 days ago, never accessed in the past 90 days

In the process, together with Domenico Giordano, of commissioning the
usage of data popularity, we may we ask your help on three points:

+ can you take a look at the list below and send us feedback if you
notice inconsistencies between the directories and the 'stale' definition;

+ we're not at this point enforcing the removal / archival (see
[4] for the recipe supported by CMS computing) of 'stale' data. 
Yet, it would be great if you could free space now (there's 143 - 157
TB of 'stale' data in group - user, respectively);
Approx 2/3 of the 'stale' data 'belong' to the cmgtools user - we're
already in contact with Colin and Zezen who have redirected this call
to the relevant people.

+ we have already received some feedback on the current definition of
'stale' data and we welcome your comments about it;

Having your feedback in the coming days will be very helpful, and
we'll need it to go back to IT with further questions and proposals to update the definition of 'stale'.

Best regards,
Andreas, Gianluca and Giovanni - CMS T3 List
