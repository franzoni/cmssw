Dear @NAME@

this is an automated message. 

It looks like some of your directories on EOS (complete list at the end of the
message) have permissions set to 777.
Since this represents a security problem, you are kindly invited to fix them
asap.

Please have a look at:

eoscms chmod --help

for more details.

Best regards,

     the EOS manager team.
