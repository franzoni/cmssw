Dear @NAME@,

we want to continue using data popularity on a bimonthly basis to manage the eos space of the CMS T3.
This strategy was introduced at the CMG group meeting in June [1];

There's some directories (full list below) in the CMS T3 eos space which belong to you
and have gone 'stale' or 'very stale', hence you receive this automated email.

The definition of 'stale' data is [2]:
   created > 120 days ago, never accessed in the past 90 days
and of 'very stale' is:
   created > 240 days ago, never accessed in the past 180 days

Several colleagues replied providing feedback and validating the pilot popularity notification of August 1st
(for this update, there might have been few glitches in the file access detection between Sep 3rd and 9th, please inform us if you establish that).
Now we ask you to please take action and free the space taken by old files,
by either archiving or removing them.

       Best regards,
       Andreas, Gianluca and Giovanni - CMS T3 admin
